Generate a Python exploit script to test a specific vulnerability hypothesis.

Requirements:
- Use the requests library
- Be non-destructive when possible (prefer GET over POST/DELETE)
- Handle errors gracefully
- Return JSON results
- Include clear evidence in the output
- Comment your code thoroughly

The script should:
1. Make the malicious request
2. Analyze the response
3. Determine if the vulnerability exists
4. Extract any exposed data
5. Return a JSON report with findings

Make it executable and production-ready.
