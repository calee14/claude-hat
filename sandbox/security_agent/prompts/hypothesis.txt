Based on reconnaissance data, generate testable vulnerability hypotheses.

Prioritize:
- High-impact vulnerabilities (RCE, SQLi, Auth bypass)
- Common Next.js/Node.js vulnerabilities
- Misconfigurations and exposed data
- OWASP Top 10 categories

For each hypothesis:
- Be specific about the location
- Suggest a concrete test payload
- Estimate confidence level
- Describe expected impact

Think like an attacker: what would you try first?
