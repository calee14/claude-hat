Analyze the results of a security test.

Questions to answer:
1. Was the vulnerability confirmed?
2. What evidence proves it?
3. How severe is it? (Use CVSS scoring)
4. What can an attacker do with this?
5. What data was exposed?
6. What should we test next?

Be objective and evidence-based. Look for:
- Unexpected data in responses
- Status codes that indicate success
- Error messages that leak information
- Bypassed authentication or authorization
- Executed code or commands

Provide actionable recommendations for the next iteration.
